				<h3>Author ~ <em>Louisa May Alcott</em></h3>
				<p  align="left">
					Little women depicts story of lives of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. It beautifully tells how the sisters grow up, find love, and find their place in the world. This semi- autobiographical novel by Louisa May Alcott has captured young women and the young at heart for so many years.
					<br> <em>“Women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they’ve got ambition, and they’ve got talent, as well as just beauty. I’m so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for.”
					― Louisa May Alcott, Little Women</em>
					<br>Reading Little women, experiencing love, life, romance, warmth and hatred taught me many things during my teen days. -- Author.

				<h3>Author ~ <em>Lucy Maud Montgomery</em></h3>
				<p>
					Set in the late 19th century, the novel recounts the adventures of 11 year old orphan girl Anne Shirley sent by mistake to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada.
					<br> <em>Anne says “Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I’ll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or in the deep, deep woods and I'd look up into the sky—up—up—up—into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer.”
					― L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables</em>
					<br>Reading makes us fall in love with a character,as they say humans don't tend to forget their first love and for me it was Anne. -- Author.

				<h3>Author ~ <em> Devdutt Pattanaik </em></h3>
				<p>
					Devdutt Pattanaik’s, Sita, An Illustrated Retelling Of The Ramayana, speculates on Sita by tracing the various phases of her life: her childhood as Janaka’s daughter; her stay in the forest with her husband; her abduction by Ravana; her interactions with the women of Lanka, the recipes they shared, the emotions they shared; her connection with the Mother Earth and Nature and her transformation from the demure goddess Gauri to untamed Kali, who chose Rama to be her dependable God. 
					<br><em>“Knowledge is like a floating log of wood that helps us stay afloat in the ocean of misery. To find the shore, we have to kick our legs and swim. No one can do that for us,”
					― Devdutt Pattanaik, Sita: An Illustrated Retelling of the Ramayana</em>
					<br>A story viewed from different perspective gives different emotions, Ramayana through Sita's eyes whom people looked over as a victim truly taught me alot. Sita is not weak, she is a woman who dares to take her own decisions. -- Author.

				<h3>Author ~ <em> Haruki Murakami</em></h3>

					As the title suggests, the book follows stories of men in their longingness and loneliness state. This is a collection of stories about rejection and moving on. It follows men as they struggle to get their bearings back after their loved ones departed.
					<br><em>“I need to learn not just to forget but to forgive.”
					― Haruki Murakami, Men Without Women</em>
